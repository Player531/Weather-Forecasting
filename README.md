# Weather-Forecasting
* A script that uses REST APIs to get information on weather of a particular city. 
* Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the Weather information.
* It also uses the IPBase API for getting the Geolocation by providing the IP address.

* Get the API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
* Get the API key from [IPBase](https://app.ipbase.com/register).

### I used tkinter to build a simplified GUI.
